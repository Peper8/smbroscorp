              As a logistics business for almost a decade, SM Bros Corp. recently ventured in the distribution of vibro sand. This new venture of supplying vibro sand will provide a more effective and efficient transportation of materials from Zambales/North Luzon to any point in the Philippines. This is to ensure materials’ end users will not run out of raw materials at any given time. Also, it can save customers and logistics services providers the trouble of coordinating logistics by deploying multiple trucks.
